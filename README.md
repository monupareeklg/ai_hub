# `AI_HUB`

Ai Hub is a place where you learn how to code and how to start your journey in `Artificial Intelligence`. This hub contains all information that needs and all the resources that requires.Anyone can use this for there study on there own.And we are a comunity so fell free to help us in contribute.Before you start make sure you have some knowledge of python and be prepare to learn ML( Machine Learning ) this hub contains all information that require.

# Books for the AI python

These are the greatest books we have used in this community to build an clean and sufficiant code

- Artificial Intelligence with Python.(2017)
- Python Machine Learning.(2015)
- Artificial Intelligence with Python: Your Complete Guide to Building Intelligent Apps Using Python 3.x, 2nd Edition.
- Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems

# Structure of the Project

This project will have Python implementations for all kinds of algorithms and necessary resources that can be implimented in any enviroment and just because its efficiancy we have developed example codes and libraries for all kind of stuffs

The first module comes with a small amount of code and small amount of hardware you need

- `light.ino`: This small code contains a small amount of code that represent how you can make a rgb light bulb run on arduino and make 8 color glowing you can make this in just few minutes.
- `circuit.brd`: This file contains all the circuit you need it has ardiuno and its full setup so fell free to chekc.

<!-- ## Installation Guide

To download the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/monupareeklg/ai_hub.git`

Then you need to install the basic dependencies to run the project on your system:

```
cd ai_hub
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then you need to run the following script:--
```
python light.py
```
And you are good to go! -->

# Hardware You Need

- **Arduino Uno**:--Arduino/Genuino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P. It has 14 digital input/output pins, 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz quartz crystal, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started.

- **Breadboard Circuit**:--The breadboard is the bread-and-butter of DIY electronics. Breadboards allow beginners to get acquainted with circuits without the need for soldering, and even seasoned tinkerers use breadboards as starting points for large-scale projects.

- **Resistor**:--A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element.

# Circuit Example

![Example](https://github.com/monupareeklg/ai_hub/blob/master/example.png?raw=true)

# What is a BRD file?

A BRD file is a **CAD** file created by Autodesk EAGLE, an application used for schematic capture and PCB (printed circuit board) design. It is created with the EAGLE Layout Editor and used to develop design templates for circuitry.

# How do I open a BRD file?

You can open a BRD file in a variety of PCB design applications, including Autodesk EAGLE (cross-platform), Altium Designer (Windows), and Open Board Viewer (Linux).

If you do not have access to any of the above applications, the easiest way to view the circuit board design contained within a BRD file is to upload it to [Altium 365 Viewer](https://www.altium.com/viewer/), a free, online CAD file viewer (Web).
