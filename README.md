# `AI_HUB`
Ai Hub is a place where you learn how to code and how to start your journey in `Artificial Intelligence`. This hub contains all information that needs and all the resources that requires.Anyone can use this for there study on there own.And we are a comunity so fell free to help us in contribute.Before you start make sure you have some knowledge of python and be prepare to learn ML( Machine Learning ) this hub contains all information that require.

# Books for the AI python

These are the greatest books we have used in this community to build an clean and sufficiant code

- Artificial Intelligence with Python.(2017)
- Python Machine Learning.(2015)
- Artificial Intelligence with Python: Your Complete Guide to Building Intelligent Apps Using Python 3.x, 2nd Edition.
- Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems

# Structure of the Project

This project will have Python implementations for all kinds of algorithms and necessary resources that can be implimented in any enviroment and just because its efficiancy we have developed example codes and libraries for all kind of stuffs 

The first module comes with a small amount of code and small amount of hardware you need 

- `light.py`: This small code contains a small amount of code that represent how you can make a light bulb turn on and off using machine learning algorithms the base of this file is python but because we are using and hardware for manipulation python comes with handy equipments like `airdino uno` and `airdino nano`. The `.py` file is represent the python extenshion ; there is a documentation avaliable in `light.ipynb` file.

## Installation Guide

To download the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/monupareeklg/ai_hub.git`

Then you need to install the basic dependencies to run the project on your system:

```
cd ai_hub
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then you need to run the following script:--
```
python light.py
```
And you are good to go!


# Algorithms Use
`Still on process to add..`

# Hardware You Need
- Arduino Uno
